With PrivateStatus you can hide the online status of your server from unwanted players. This is especially worthwhile for private servers with a whitelist to prevent this. This plugin only works on Paper 1.20+ and is not compatible with Spigot.

## Configuration

After the first start of the plugin, a `config.yml` file is created in the folder `plugins/PrivateStatus`. There, the option `expiration-days` can be configured, which determines the maximum length of time an IP address should be stored.

## Commands

There are no commands.
