With PrivateStatus you can hide the online status of your server from unwanted players. This is especially worthwhile for private servers with a whitelist to prevent this. This plugin only works on Paper 1.20+ and is not compatible with Spigot. This is because this plugin relies on the so called `ServerListPingEvent` which can only be cancelled when using Paper.

## Configuration

The configuration is in `plugins/PrivateStatus/config.yml` and looks like this. Please only edit the `expiration-minutes` option. The `known-addresses` section is managed by the plugin itself. The option `expiration-minutes` defines how long an address should be kept in the history. The plugin automatically checks every 10 minutes if entries expired. If so, it removes them.

```yaml
# The amount of minutes after which addresses will expire. Minimum: 10.
expiration-minutes: 1440

# A list of already known addresses.
known-addresses: {}
```
