With PrivateStatus you can hide the online status of your server from unwanted players. This is especially worthwhile for private servers with a whitelist to prevent this. This plugin only works on Paper 1.20+ and is not compatible with Spigot.

## Configuration

The configuration is in `plugins/PrivateStatus/config.yml` and looks like this. Please edit only the `expiration-days` option. The `known-addresses` section is managed by the plugin itself. The option `expiration-days` defines how long an address should be kept in the history. This period is checked every hour and relevant entries are removed.

```yaml
# The amount of days after which addresses will expire. Minimum: 1.
expiration-days: 3

# A list of already known addresses.
known-addresses: {}
```
